# WordPress version checker

A GitHub app to automatically create issues when a plugin "tested up to" version doesn't match the latest WordPress version. Made with [Probot](https://probot.github.io/).

This app is deployed for this organization only at [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/skaut-wordpress-version-checker).

If you want to add your own repo, you need to install the app and add the repo config to `data/repos.json`.
